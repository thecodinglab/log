# Log

`github.com/thecodinglab/log` is another structured logging library for Golang.
It has been inspired by some other awesome logging libraries such
as [logrus](https://github.com/sirupsen/logrus)
and [zap](https://github.com/uber-go/zap).

I started with this library to combine my personal logging stack into a single
library which I can simply import in all of my projects. I am still heavily
working on this, so I don't recommend using it in production. However, if you
have any feedback or suggestions, feel free to open an issue or pull request.

## Usage

```shell
go get -u github.com/thecodinglab/log
```
